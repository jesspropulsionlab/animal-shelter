            <h4>This is Puggington.</h4>
            <p>He is a pug, who enjoys spending his free time dressed
            as a unicorn. He's a unipug. He's a pugicorn. Whatever he is, he's fabulous. He likes 
            long walks, but can't breathe well enough to go on them. He likes rainy weather, but 
            hates being wet. He also loves human food, but is on a strict canned dog food diet. 
            He loves children, but can't stand babies. He smells all the time, and 
            has terrible gas. He also enjoys being pushed around in a stroller. What a catch!</p>

            <h4>This is Cornwallis.</h4>
            <p>Cornwallis has a lot of energy. He probably would love nothing
            more to go hunting all day, and bring back lots of beautiful waterfoal for his owners. 
            Alas, we'll never know for sure, because Cornwallis is deathly allergic to birds. He doesn't
            like children, and seems to hate older women, but would do really well in a house with a 
            couple of men, and no other pets. Definitely no birds. He is very cuddly, but also sheds
            like a sheep, if sheep shed. He is very soft, so there's that.</p>

            <h4>This is Georgia.</h4>
            <p>Georgia is the happiest dog we've ever had in our shelter. She smiles constantly.
            We've never heard he make sad sounds, or even look sad. When you are around her, you can't 
            be sad either. It's literally impossible. She loves everyone and everything, and she's
            perfect. When I see her, my heart feels lighter. All of my stomach issues, and heart 
            palpatations just float away. She is a <em>purr</em>-fect princess. On second thought...
            maybe she is not available.</p>

              <h4>This is Remus.</h4>
              <p>Remus is a baby. Literally, he is a kitten. But more than that, he seems very
              young, and naive. He's probably never had anything bad happen to him yet, that's probably
              why. Just wait, young Remus. Soon, you'll grow up and realize that everything is terrible.
              People will judge you, because you're sort of a redhead cat. They won't want you teaching
              their children, and eventually you'll have a son named Teddy who you will wind up orphaning,
              due to your good-heartedness, despite the difficulties you've endured in your life.</p>

              <h4>This is Jefe</h4>
              <p>Jefe is in charge. He's a no nonsense kind of cat. He hates everyone. He's basically
              the exact opposite of Georgia. He always seems mad. No idea about what, though. He always
              looks grumpy. He seems incapable of making any face other than sourpuss. But for all of his
              negativity, he always has a soothing presence. He'll stay in a room with you, even though
              it's pretty obvious he'd rather be alone. Sometimes he'll let out a tiny meow that let's you
              know that even though he hates you, he's still got your back.</p>

              <h4>This is Patricia</h4>
              <p>Patricia was named by a small child, and we know it isn't a great name for a cat, but 
              we didn't have the heart to tell her it sucked. Patricia is a pretty average cat. She likes
              her alone time, but she'll also lay near you on the couch. She has never been outside, so she
              doesn't know what she's missing in that regard. She does use a litter box, but she isn't great
              at covering her turds up. Maybe no one ever taught her how. She's terrible when it comes to
              knocking things off of tables, but she usually looks sorry after she does it.</p>

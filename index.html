        <h4>This is Puggington.</h4>
        <p>He is a pug, who enjoys spending his free time dressed
        as a unicorn. He's a unipug. He's a pugicorn. Whatever he is, he's fabulous. He likes 
        long walks, but can't breathe well enough to go on them. He likes rainy weather, but 
        hates being wet. He also loves human food, but is on a strict canned dog food diet. 
        He loves children, but can't stand babies. He smells all the time, and 
        has terrible gas. What a catch!</p>

        <h4>This is Cornwallis.</h4>
        <p>Cornwallis has a lot of energy. He probably would love nothing
        more to go hunting all day, and bring back lots of beautiful waterfoal for his owners. 
        Alas, we'll never know for sure, because Cornwallis is deathly allergic to birds. He doesn't
        like children, and seems to hate older women, but would do really well in a house with a 
        couple of men, and no other pets. Definitely no birds.</p>

        <h4>This is Georgia.</h4>
        <p>Georgia is the happiest dog we've ever had in our shelter. She smiles constantly.
        We've never heard he make sad sounds, or even look sad. When you are around her, you can't 
        be sad either. It's literally impossible. She loves everyone and everything, and she's
        perfect. When I see her, my heart feels lighter. All of my stomach issues, and heart 
        palpatations just...float away. On second thought...maybe she is not available.</p>

        <h4>This is Remus.</h4>
        <p>Remus is a baby. Literally, he is a kitten. But more than that, he seems very
        young, and naive. He's probably never had anything bad happen to him yet, that's probably
        why. Just wait, young Remus. Soon, you'll grow up and realize that everything is terrible.
        People will judge you, because you're sort of a redhead cat. They won't want you teaching
        their children, and eventually you'll have a son named Teddy who you will wind up orphaning,
        due to your good-heartedness, despite the difficulties you've endured in your life.</p>
